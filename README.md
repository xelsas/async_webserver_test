# async_webserver_test
 Simple test creating a webserver using ESPAsyncWebServer (https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer) to control a MAX7219 led matrix with eight 8x8 panels.
 
 Start with WiFi in access point mode with captive portal if no WiFi connection can be made. When a connection has been made disable the DNS server and start mDNS (technically both are disabled when setting up WiFi, and either mDNS or the captive portal is started). Once a connection with WiFi has been made, if disconnected, just keep trying to reconnect.
 
 ToDo:
 - Add a (physical) reset button to reset the WiFi settings
```
